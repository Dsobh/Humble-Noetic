**List of Bridges**

| Bridge | Topic |
| ------ | ----- |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_tf | /tf |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_scan | /scan |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_odom | /mobile_base_controller/odom |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_image | /xtion/rgb/image_raw |
| simple_bridge_2_to_1_twist | /mobile_base_controller/cmd_vel |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_imu | /base_imu |


## Instructions

- Build the docker image. In folder root:

	```bash
	$ docker build -t <imageName>:<imageTag> .
	```
- Is also possible to pull the docker image from docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dsobh/ros4ubuntu22/general

- Run docker image: 

	```bash
	$ docker run -it <imageName>:<imageTag> /bin/bash
	```

### Execute ros1_bridge

- 1ยบ Terminal (ROS1):

	```bash
	$ source /root/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash #Source Noetic
	$ roscore
	```
	
- 2ยบ Terminal (ROS1 + ROS2). *In most cases, this will not be necessary, since docker starts with the execution of a roslaunch file that deploys the bridges.*

	```bash
	#Source humble
	$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash 
	$ source /root/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
	
	#Source noetic
	$source /root/catkin_ws/devel/setup
	
	#Launch bridge 
	$ ros2 run ros1_bridge <bridge_name> --ros-args -p topic_name:=<topic_name>
	```
	
### Bridge configuration

This image uses one yaml file to set which bridges to display. This file is named conf.yaml and it contains information about the Ip. This information is used as follows:

```
$ exports ROS_MASTER_URI=http://IP_number:11311
$ exports ROS_URI=Ip_number

```

The roslaunch file used will create the necessary nodes from conf.yaml
An example of this configuration file is show below:

```
bridges:
  - bridge1:
    - msg_type: /msg/Twist
    - topic_name: /mobile_base_controller/cmd_vel
  - bridge2:
    - msg_type: /geometry_msgs/msg/odom
    - topic_name: /mobile_base_controller/odom
    
```
