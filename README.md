## Description 
This repository contains a a dockerfile that allows execute Ros1 (Noetic) with Ros2 (Humble) over a Ubuntu 22 image. The dockerfile image includes a version of the [`ros1_bridges`](#https://github.com/Dsobh/ros1_bridge) package, that contains several [bridges](#bridges).

The dockerfile installs two version of ROS:
- `Ros Humble` is installed from package.
- `Ros Noetic` is installed from source.

Is also possible to find the latest docker image from docker hub: [`dsobh/ros4ubuntu22`](#https://hub.docker.com/layers/dsobh/ros4ubuntu22/latest/images/sha256-803d6297a9821ec4ad42c764179fc7e0e0bdb18fb59f0b956a865bd7f535f2eb?context=repo)

We can pull the image as follows:
```
docker push dsobh/ros4ubuntu22:latest
```

### Content

In order to build the final image, this dockerfile includes the following files:
- */src/others/noetic-desktop.rosinstall* contains the packages needed for noetic installation
- */src/others/rosconsole_log4cxx.cpp* is a modification of the source code of log4cxx to make it functional in ubuntu 22.
- */src/others/docker-entrypoint.sh* is the entrypoint for the docker that is responsible for making sources for Ros1 and Ros2 and launch the launch.py file.
- */src/others/ros1_bridges.service

- */src/install/system-utils.sh* contains installations of utilities for ubuntu 22
- */src/install/ros-packages.sh* contains installation of packages needed for ros
- */src/install/cloneGit.sh* is a script that download and unzip all of these packages.
- */src/install/ros1.sh* contains the installation of ros1 (noetic)
- */src/install/ros2.sh* contains the installation of ros2 (humble)
- */src/install/bridges-install.sh* contains the installation of ros1_bridges (https://github.com/Dsobh/ros1_bridge)


### Bridges

Listed below are the different bridges that are included in the image along with the topic and type of message they use.

| Bridge | Topic | Msg Type |
| ------ | ----- | -------- |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_tf | /tf | tf |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_scan | /scan | scan | 
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_odom | /mobile_base_controller/odom | odom |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_image | /xtion/rgb/image_raw & /xtion/depth/image_raw | image |
| simple_bridge_2_to_1_twist | /mobile_base_controller/cmd_vel | twist |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_imu | /base_imu | imu |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_sonar | /sonar_base | range |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_compressed | /xtion/rgb/image_raw/compressed & /xtion/depth/image_raw/compressed | compressed |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_point_cloud | /xtion/depth/points | point_cloud2 |
| simple_bridge_1_to_2_camera_info | /xtion/rgb/camera_info | camera_info |

## Instructions

### Build Dockerfile

- Build the docker image. In folder root:

```bash
	$ docker build -t <imageName>:<imageTag> .
```

### Run Docker

This docker is designed to execute inside of a robot like TiaGo. The docker start with a linux service that setup the differents bridges.
However, is possible to launch the docker manually as follows.

#### Run docker image:

We need to keep in mind a few things when launching the container. First of all is setting environment variables (ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP) with the **--env** flag. Secondly we will use the **--network** flag to start the container as host.
We also need to pass the **conf.yaml** file (**absolute path**) to the docker when we run it.

```bash
	$ docker run --rm --env ROS_MASTER_URI='http://10.68.0.1:11311' --env ROS_IP='10.68.0.129' --env RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp --network host -v /<AbsolutePath>/conf.yaml:/root/conf.yaml -it rep:tag
```
	
We can start the docker without the entrypoint with the next command:

```bash
	$ docker run --rm --env ROS_MASTER_URI='http://10.68.0.1:11311' --env ROS_IP='10.68.0.131' --env RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp --network host -v /conf.yaml:/root/conf.yaml -it --entrypoint bash dsobh/ros4ubuntu22:latest
```

### Execute ros1_bridge
The image automatically starts the bridges, but in case the user wants to start it manually :

- 1ยบ Terminal (ROS1):

```bash
	$ source /root/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash #Source Noetic
	$ roscore
```
	
- 2ยบ Terminal (ROS1 + ROS2). *In most cases, this will not be necessary, since docker starts with the execution of a roslaunch file that deploys the bridges.*

```bash
	#Source humble
	$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash 
	$ source /root/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
	
	#Source noetic
	$source /root/catkin_ws/devel/setup
	
	#Launch bridge 
	$ ros2 run ros1_bridge <bridge_name> --ros-args -p topic_name:=<topic_name>
```
	
### Bridge configuration

This image uses one yaml file to set which bridges to display. This file is named conf.yaml and it contains information about the bridges.
The roslaunch file used will create the necessary nodes from this conf.yaml
An example of this configuration file is show below:

```bash
bridges:
  - bridge1:
    - msg_type: /msg/Twist
    - topic_name: /mobile_base_controller/cmd_vel
  - bridge2:
    - msg_type: /geometry_msgs/msg/odom
    - topic_name: /mobile_base_controller/odom
    
```

### TiaGo SetUp

To use the bridges package as a service in TiaGo the file `ros1_bridges.service` can be used. The file must be moved to `/etc/systemd/system/ros1_bridges.service` within TiaGo.

In the other hand, `conf.yaml` file should be stored in the overlay:

```
sudo overlayroot_chroot
```
